		<div class="panel">
			<p>We rescue and rehabilitate companion animals in Ohio.  We also work to reduce the pet overpopulation by sponsoring low cost spays/neuters and assist with vet bills when possible. </p>
		</div>
		
		<button class="accordion"> How does Storm's Angels use donations?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>All donations go towards the care of the animals in the rescue (and community outreach).  We do not employ any paid staff and all operation expenses are underwritten by volunteers. </p>
		</div>
		
		<button class="accordion"> Why should I adopt?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Companion animals are killed at an alarming rate daily (approximately 15000 cats per day and 10000 dogs per day) due to overcrowding in shelters.  Many of these animals are puppies and even pure bred dogs and cats.  Adoption saves lives.  Please adopt, don't shop! </p>
		</div>
		
		<button class="accordion"> What does the rescue provide when I foster?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Storm's Angels provides all basic needs for any foster animal.  For dogs we provide a crate, collar/harness, leash, food, and any other supplies.  For cats we provide a travel crate (for vet appointments), collar, food, litter box and supplies.  Supplies will be provided for other animals as needed.  Foster homes provide love and attention.   </p>
		</div>
		
		<button class="accordion"> What is the adoption application process?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>First step is to fill out an adoption application on our website.  If you would like a paper form please e-mail us at stormsangelsrescue@gmail.com.  Applications can take up to a week to process.  We require 2 meet and greets for dogs and 1 for cats.  The adoption fee helps to cover the animal's vetting including spay/neuter, microchip, and all vaccines.  Dogs come with a collar, leash, and harness (or head halti).  All animals come with a small bag of their current food.  Adoption fees are tax deductible to the amount allowed by law and nonrefundable. </p>
